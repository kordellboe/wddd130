                <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! This trip is a blast for kids of all ages. Weve noticed that kids over 8 have an especially great time (and parents love it more when their kids are all over 8 too!). Some parents worry their kids might get bored being on a boat for hours. But guess what? We hardly ever see any bored kids, no matter their age!</p>

                <h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
                <p>Just like any adventure sport, there's a bit of risk involved. But don't worry! Our guides are all pros with Wilderness First Aid certification and at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and little mishaps on land.

                    Everyone on our rafting trips wears a Coast Guard-approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Even non-swimmers join in and have a blast!</p>

                <h3>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
                <p>Let's describe a common day on the river...<br>
                    Wake up in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner</p>

                <h3>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h3>
                <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
